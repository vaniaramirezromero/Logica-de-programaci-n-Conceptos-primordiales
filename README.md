****I took this course for the Oracle ONE Education program - Programming Logic: Core Concepts****

 ****Where I learned:****

- Convert string to number using `parseInt`.
- Working with `if` and `else` conditions.
- Using mathematical formulas such as `Math.random` and `Math.round`.
- Repeating tasks and activities with `while` iterations.
- Repeating tasks and activities with `for` iterations.
- Interrupt iterations with `break`.
- Perform nested iterations, a `loop` inside another.
- Improve user interaction with the use of buttons.
- To improve user interaction with the use of text boxes.
- To improve the usability of our program with `focus`.
- Concept and dynamics of arrays.
- Using iterations to load arrays.
- Discovering the size of arrays.
- Manually entering values into arrays with the `push` function.
- Solve more complex problems using several programming concepts together in the same program (loops, arrays, conditions, functions and mathematical formulas).
